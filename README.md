# Wall-Pong
 A simple pong-like game where you create obstacles to make a goal against your opponent.

## Mechanics
 Use `left mouse click` to create obstacles for the ball to bounce.

 An energy bar will deplete when you create or destroy obstacles, if you run out of energy you won't be able to do anything until the energy regenerates over time.
 
 It is possible to host and join online games using the "HOST GAME" option in the main menu.

 Since there are not a lot of examples of Unity projects on GitHub, perhaps this will be a reasonable source of knowledge for beginners (albeit I have to improve the documentation to make the code understandable).
 
 Finally, any suggestions and changes are appreciated, feel free to improve and change the code as you like.
